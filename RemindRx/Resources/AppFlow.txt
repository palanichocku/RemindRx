Here's a visual walkthrough of how a single medicine (MucinexDM) flows through the RemindRx app:

# MucinexDM Flow Through RemindRx App

The diagram above visualizes how a specific medicine (MucinexDM) flows through the RemindRx app from scanning to management. Let me explain each step:

## Step 1: Barcode Scanning
- User opens the app and taps the "Scan" button or tab
- Camera activates and the user scans the MucinexDM barcode (e.g., "3086123344578")
- `BarcodeScannerView` captures this barcode string
- `DrugLookupService` sends API requests to various drug databases
- Drug information is retrieved, including:
  - Name: "MucinexDM"
  - Manufacturer: "Reckitt Benckiser"
  - Type: OTC (Over The Counter)

## Step 2: Form Completion
- `MedicineFormView` is displayed, pre-populated with the data from the APIs
- User adds the expiration date (12/15/2025) using the date picker
- User sets alert preference to "1 Month Before"
- User adds description: "Extended release guaifenesin"
- User taps the "Save" button
- `MedicineStore.save()` method is called

## Step 3: Data Storage
- A `Medicine` object is created with all the details:
  - UUID: a unique identifier
  - name: "MucinexDM"
  - manufacturer: "Reckitt Benckiser"
  - expirationDate: 12/15/2025
  - alertInterval: 1 month (.month)
- `CoreDataManager.saveMedicine()` converts this to a `MedicineEntity`
- The entity is stored in Core Data persistent storage
- `NotificationManager` schedules an expiration alert for 11/15/2025 (1 month before expiry)

## Step 4: Viewing & Managing
- User returns to `MedicineListView` which displays MucinexDM in the list
- User can tap on the MucinexDM item to see more details
- `MedicineDetailView` shows all medicine information
- The medicine shows as "VALID" since it's not close to expiration
- User can:
  - View complete medicine details
  - Delete the medicine if needed
  - See visual indicators of expiry status

## Future Event: Notification
- On 11/15/2025, the system will trigger a notification
- User receives an alert: "MucinexDM will expire on 12/15/2025"
- Tapping the notification can take the user directly to the medicine details

This flow demonstrates how data moves through the app's components:
- From UI components (scanner, forms)
- Through business logic (MedicineStore, DrugLookupService)
- Into persistent storage (CoreDataManager, Core Data)
- Back to the UI for display and management
- And finally to the notification system for alerts

Each component has clear responsibilities and communicates with others through well-defined interfaces, creating a cohesive user experience.
